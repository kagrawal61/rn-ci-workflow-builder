# React Native CI/CD Web Builder PRD

## Project Overview

The React Native CI/CD Web Builder is a web application that allows developers to generate customized GitHub Actions workflows for their React Native projects. This web interface will build upon our existing `rn-ci-workflow-builder` CLI tool to provide a user-friendly, visual way to create and configure CI/CD workflows without requiring command-line knowledge. The initial version will focus on the health check preset for bare React Native apps, with an architecture that supports expanding to additional presets and project types in future releases.

## Market Need

- React Native developers need simple CI/CD solutions that don't require subscription fees
- Developers prefer visual interfaces for configuring complex GitHub Actions workflows
- Setting up proper CI/CD checks for React Native requires technical knowledge of multiple tools (TypeScript, ESLint, Jest, etc.)
- GitHub Actions provides free CI/CD minutes, but requires complex YAML configuration
- Teams need consistent quality checks across projects

## Core Features

### 1. Workflow Configuration Interface

The web application will provide an elegant, interactive form for configuring GitHub Actions workflows:

- **Initial Focus: Health Check for Bare React Native**
  - The first version will focus exclusively on generating health check workflows for bare React Native apps
  - The interface will be designed to accommodate additional project types and workflow presets in future

- **Health Check Configuration Options** (Based on current preset)
  - Workflow name customization
  - Trigger events:
    - Push (configurable branches and ignore paths)
    - Pull request (configurable target branches)
    - Manual workflow dispatch toggle
    - Schedule (cron expressions)
  - Node.js versions selection (multiple via chips/tags)
  - Package manager selection (npm, yarn)
  - Runner OS/platform selection
  - Skip conditions (configurable commit message, PR title, or label filters)
  - Environment variables and secrets management
  - Cache configuration options

- **Advanced Options**
  - Custom commands injection points
  - Concurrency settings
  - Custom runner selection

### 2. Workflow Preview

- Real-time validation with inline error messages
- Micro-interactions and animations for engaging feedback
- Progress indicator showing configuration completion
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility support
- One-click direct GitHub integration (future feature)

## Technical Implementation

### Workflow Generation

1. The web UI will collect configuration options through a multi-step form
2. On form submission, the app will:
   - Send the configuration to a serverless API route
   - The API will use our `rn-ci-workflow-builder` library to generate the workflow YAML
   - Return the generated YAML to the client

### Core Functions

- `generateWorkflowFromWebForm(config)`: Adapts web form data to the library's configuration format
- `validateWorkflowConfig(config)`: Validates user input before generating workflow
- `getPresetOptions(presetType)`: Returns available options for the selected preset

### Integration with Existing Library

The web application will use our existing `rn-ci-workflow-builder` library as a dependency, focusing initially on the health check preset but designed for future expansion:

- Preset builder: Initially `buildHealthCheckPipeline`, with architecture to support additional presets
- Helper functions: `buildTriggers`, `buildEnv`, `buildSkipCondition`, `cacheSteps`, etc.
- Type definitions: Will use `WorkflowConfig`, `WorkflowOptions`, `TriggerOptions`, and other existing TypeScript interfaces
- Preset discovery: Will use the `getAvailablePresets()` function to dynamically detect available workflow types

The UI will be dynamically generated based on the available options in the current preset, making it future-proof as new presets are added to the library.
